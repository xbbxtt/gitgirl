In my first merge - I adjusted the job detail page to show the job description.
In my second merge - I made another adjustment to the footer to reflect functional social media links. I also made a minor adjustment to the job detail page so the jumbotron went further down the page, and made a maxHeight/maxWidth for the company url logos. I also made a change in the JobTable.jsx to set the page height so the footer was not under the navbar.

In my first merge - I created the createJobForm.jsx file. I updated the main.jsx to have the path.
In my second merge - I added the updated path to the UserNavigation.jsx file so a logged in user can effectively click the 'post a job' button and show when that button is active.
